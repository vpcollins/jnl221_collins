			<li><strong>How is this data organized and collected?</strong> This dataset is titled “Crime Data 2025 Part 1 Offenses With Lat and Long Info.” It has information on specific crimes in Syracuse, NY that occurred this year. The data is organized by date, time, location, the code of the crime, and if an arrest was made. The data was collected by the city of Syracuse, more specifically by the police department.</li>
			<li><strong>Why is this newsworthy?</strong> This set is newsworthy because it shows Syracuse citizens how prevalent crime is in the area and what crimes may be more common than others. A good audience for the dataset is the citizens of Syracuse or people who are interested in moving to the city of Syracuse.</li>
			<li><strong>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this data set?</strong> One data hypothesis I could make about the data is that more theft occurred in the city of Syracuse in 2025 than aggravated assault. This knowledge could help homeowners better fortify their properties and help those moving in better understand the neighborhoods they’re looking at. <a href="https://data.syr.gov/datasets/92bcecf4355140a98b9bba3cd8ecdca2_0/explore?location=43.040120%2C-76.148688%2C12.98&showTable=true" target="_blank">Click here for the link</a></li>

			<li><strong>How is this data organized and collected?</strong> This dataset lists the number of days per year that have bad air quality in the city of Philadelphia.It is titled “Air Quality Index Days,” and dates to 1990. The data set is very simple, organized by year and then how many days the air was “good,” “moderate,” or “unhealthy.”</li>
			<li><strong>Why is this newsworthy?</strong> This is newsworthy because its air quality trends over time and could inform city residents of a potential public health crisis. The data could also link to local or state policies, like vehicle emissions regulations, and show what laws are impacting the environment. A good audience for the story is the citizens of Philadelphia but more specifically legislators and physicians in the area.</li>
			<li><strong>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this data set?</strong> A potential data hypothesis for the set is the air quality in the city of Philadelphia has improved since 1990. <a href="https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/air-quality-index-days/" target="_blank">Click here for the link</a></li>
