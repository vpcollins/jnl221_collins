			<p>Looking ahead, the Bronx will see more than 1,000 tree plantings in the December 2025 season, an almost 50% increase from the previous planting season. In the January 2026 season, there are no tree plantings planned for the Manhattan or Staten Island boroughs, but over 1,500 planned for Queens. Of the six tree plantings planned for Manhattan in the June 2026 planting season, two will be on West End Avenue and two on Columbus Avenue, all in the city councilâ€™s 6th District.
