			<p>I wanted to research food deserts in the city of Syracuse and Onondaga County as a whole. I found a document that tracks food deserts in Syracuse but it's from 2017. The document originated on the Onondaga County Health Department's website. Other than that, there was very little information availible on MuckRock for the Syracuse area. I broadened my search to all of New York and found lots of information on food waste across the state.
