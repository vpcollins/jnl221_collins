			<strong>Data Hypothesis?</strong> My data hypothesis is that restaurants that are inspected in the summer months acquire more violations than those insepcted in winter month. I think this is newsworthy because it could show that businesses aren't taking proper precautions for the weather changing. It could also show a flaw in the inspection system. For example, if a restaurant acquires a critical violations in June, doesn't make any changes, then passes in December, that's a safety problem for customers and restaurant owners. <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Onondaga-County-Restaurant-Inspections/tbxv-5tbd/data_preview" target="_blank">I used this link to build my hypothesis.</a></li>
