			<h3>Geography of Neglect</h3>

			<p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is facing a threat more pressing than administration changes or policy failures: a food scarcity that disproportionately harms its poorest communities.</p>
			<p>The neighborhoods that are forced to rely on convenience stores and food stands as means of nutrition, are also those who have the least amount of access to community service organizations. This inequality and lack of resources stems from a long history of deindustrialization and disinvestment in the city.</p>
			<p>Kensington, a neighborhood in North Philadelphia, exemplifies the city’s neglect. The New York Times has described it as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/briefing/gun-violence-united-states.html">one of the most violent places in the United States,</a> and the area been referred to as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/magazine/kensington-heroin-opioid-philadelphia.html">“Walmart of Heroin.” </a> These labels are underscored by the greater drug crisis the city faces.</p>
			<p>“In 2023, Philadelphia had a total of 1,315 overdose deaths according to data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. In addition, 79% of the 2023 overdose deaths in Philadelphia included fentanyl,” the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/operation-engage/philadelphia">DEA</a> reported.</p>
			<p>Kensington also contains Philadelphia’s poorest zip code, 19134. According to data compiled by the non-profit organization <a href="https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/RAPper/blob/master/resources.csv">Code For Philly</a>, that zip code only has one community service organization located within its boundaries: an HIV prevention supply service. Comparatively, the highest concentration of resources are located in the zip code 19107.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/19107/">The area located within 19107</a>, despite having the most amount of resources, is a very small portion of the city. City Hall is located within this zip code and sits at the center of downtown, referred to as Center City by locals. It also hosts Suburban Station, a popular subway stop for many commuters, tourist attractions and numerous office buildings.</p>

			<h3>How Uneven Resources Drive Food Scarcity</h3>
			<p>The geographic distribution of service organizations shows a concentration in more convenient and accessible areas, rather than the poorer parts of the city. These poorer parts are also where food deserts are most common. A food desert is an area lacking healthy, affordable, food options.</p>
			<p>Based off of data compiled by the <a href="https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/568d4b3c13d1bebc0c2a2b0f/representationdetails/5d4c6e160f63a20011c21727/">City of Philadelphia</a>, of the city blocks that exist in high poverty, about 14% are located where access to fresh produce is limited or nonexistent.</p>

			<p>In addition to identifying food deserts, the City of Philadelphia tracked the availability of high-produce supply stores compared to low-produce supply stores. HPSSs refer to places like supermarkets and farmers markets while LPSSs mean dollar stores, pharmacies, and convenience stores.</p>
			<p>There are 164.12% more LPSS’ in areas of high poverty than the amount of HPSS’s and overall 57% less food stores availible in areas of high poverty compared to areas that are not.</p>
			<iframe title="There is a 55% difference between the amount of LPSSs in high poverty areas and lower poverty areas." aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-BeMpc" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BeMpc/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="226" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
			<p>With limited access to supermarkets, fresh food, and food assistance programs, residents living in high poverty areas are forced to rely on stores that offer unhealthy options at higher prices. This imbalance has caused many non-profit organziations to step in and try to bridge the gap.</p>

			<h3>Non-profits try to help, but the gap remains</h3>
			<p>The Philadelphia College of Oesthopeathic Medicine partnered with Bebashi: Transition to Hope <a href="https://www.pcom.edu/campuses/philadelphia-campus/news-and-events/pcom-news/pcom-opens-food-pantries-at-area-healthcare-centers.html">in 2020 to add food pantry’s</a> to two of its healthcare centers. In 2023, PCOM opened its third pantry on its West Philadelphia campus. The pantries provide boxed and canned food, fresh fruit and meats, and bottled water.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.pcom.edu/campuses/philadelphia-campus/news-and-events/pcom-news/pcom-takes-on-food-insecurity-in-philadelphia.html">According to PCOM</a>, as of Mar. 2023, the pantries distributed over 5,000 pounds of food to over 2,400 families.</p>
			<p>“We purchase healthy options and encourage healthy eating by providing recipes with various ideas on preparing the groceries that are distributed,” said Chandra Tyler, an administrative project manager at PCOM. “Besides providing for food insecurities, we also look at nutrition and social determinants of health.”</p>
			<p>Tyler explained that the pantries saw significant increases in demand after the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent government shut down that harmed SNAP benefits.</p>
			<p>“What’s especially noticeable is that the demand isn’t just higher—it’s more consistent. Families who previously came only during emergencies are now relying on us regularly,” she said. “In neighborhoods already experiencing limited food access, the need has deepened, and we’re seeing more working families, more seniors, and more young adults seeking support.”</p>
			<p>While PCOM and other institutions, like <a href="https://www.philabundance.org/">Philadabundance</a> and the <a href="https://towerhealth.org/articles/combating-food-insecurity-north-philly">Mama-Tee Community Fridge</a>, have made immense progress in feeding the people of Philadelphia, there is still a significant gap in access to nutritious food.</p>
			<iframe title="Of Code for Philly's list of community service organizations, 46% of Philadelphia's are emergency shelters." aria-label="Donut Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-i9w3P" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/i9w3P/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="661" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

			<p>Of all of the community resource organizations Code for Philly cataloged, only 20% of them provide emergency food services to Philadelphia residents, highlighting how limited nutrition assistance is in the city. Specifically in high poverty neighborhoods, where access to HPSSs is already limited, this small share of food focused service organizations further restrains the options for residents who aim to regularly eat nutritious meals.</p>

			<p>“[A] misconception is that hunger is temporary or tied only to emergencies, when in reality many families struggle consistently even when they’re doing everything they can,” Tyler said. “The resilience of the people we serve is often overlooked. They’re not looking for handouts, just stability and access to basic resources.”</p>
